# Walrus-SDK

## What is Walrus-SDK?

Walrus-SDK is a TypeScript-based Software Development Kit (SDK) designed to simplify interaction with the Walrus decentralized storage network. It provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for uploading, retrieving, and managing files within decentralized environments.

By abstracting complex API calls, Walrus-SDK accelerates development, enhances consistency, and promotes the adoption of Walrus decentralized storage solution.

## What is Walrus?

Walrus is a decentralized storage and data availability protocol designed for large binary files, or blobs. It offers a robust solution for storing unstructured content across decentralized nodes, ensuring high availability and reliability even in the presence of faults. By integrating with the Sui blockchain, Walrus leverages its composability, expressivity, and security to provide a seamless storage experience.

## Why Walrus-SDK?

Directly interacting with decentralized storage APIs can be cumbersome and error-prone. Walrus-SDK solves this by:

- Providing **high-level abstractions** for file uploads and retrievals.
- Offering **developer-friendly utilities** such as type-safe interfaces and built-in error handling.
- Simplifying integration into **modern web and blockchain applications**.
- Accelerating development by reducing boilerplate code.

## Project Structure

The `sdk-demo` folder contains the source code for the Walrus-SDK, which is also available as an npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/walrus-sdk). To get started with Walrus-SDK, refer to the [README.md in the `sdk-demo` folder](https://github.com/harshkas4na/Walrus-SDK/tree/main/sdk-demo).

The `FRONTEND` folder includes a demo application that demonstrates how to use the SDK for uploading and downloading files to the Walrus network. For instructions on running the demo application, check the [README.md in the `FRONTEND` folder](https://github.com/harshkas4na/Walrus-SDK/tree/main/FRONTEND).
